<p>Paris Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American media personality, businesswoman, model, singer, actress, and DJ. She first rose to fame in the early 2000s through modeling and her reality TV show The Simple Life, which she starred in alongside Nicole Richie. Known for her glamorous lifestyle and signature catchphrase <span style="background-color: aliceblue;">"thats hot"</span>, she became one of the first reality TV celebrities to turn fame into a brand.
Over the years, Hilton has expanded into multiple ventures, including fashion, fragrances, music, and a successful DJ career, earning recognition as a savvy entrepreneur. Beyond her public persona, she has also become an advocate for survivors of abuse, sharing her own experiences to raise awareness and push for reform.
Often referred to as the “original influencer,” Paris Hilton helped shape the era of celebrity culture and social media fame that followed. Beyond reality TV, Hilton built a multi-faceted career. She released music, including the 2006 single “Stars Are Blind” which became a global hit, acted in films, and later reinvented herself as a successful DJ and performer, playing major clubs and festivals worldwide. She also became a savvy entrepreneur, launching fragrances, fashion lines, and other branded products. Her perfume collection alone has generated billions in revenue.
Paris Hilton is often credited with being one of the first people to embody “famous for being famous”—a forerunner to the influencer culture that dominates today. However, in recent years, she has reshaped her image by discussing the challenges behind her public persona. In her 2020 documentary “This Is Paris,” she opened up about her experiences with abuse at boarding school and the pressures of fame, offering fans a more authentic look at her life.Today, Hilton remains active as a businesswoman, DJ, activist, and content creator, while also advocating for reform in the “troubled teen industry.” She has married venture capitalist Carter Reum and has become a mother, marking a new chapter in her personal life. In more recent years, Hilton has opened up about her personal struggles, revealing in her 2020 documentary This Is Paris the abuse she faced at a “troubled teen” boarding school. Since then, she has become an advocate for reform in youth residential programs, using her platform for activism.This Is Paris (2020), a YouTube Originals documentary directed by Alexandra Dean, focuses on her personal and professional trajectory.[204][205] In the film, Hilton revealed her experiences with emotional, verbal and physical abuse while attending a series of boarding schools as a teenager. Unprepared to disclose that information, she trusted Dean's approach and found the process of filming to be a healing space for her. She served as a producer but did not have artistic authority over the production.[206] It received over 16 million views in its first month of release and was deemed a successful "rebranding" of her image.[207][208]
Between 2020 and 2024, Hilton appeared in advertisement campaigns for Skims,[209] Valentino,[210] Lanvin,[211] Uber Eats,[212] Hilton Hotels & Resorts,[213] Klarna, Marc Jacobs,[214] Taco Bell,[215] Grey Goose,[216] NBCUniversal's coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics,[217] MSCHF–Crocs' Big Yellow Boots, Living Proof,[218] and WOW Vegas.[219] With Klarna, she opened a pop-up store which ran from February 23 to 24, 2023 in Los Angeles.[220] In 2020, Hilton served as a guest judge in the premiere episode of James Charles's YouTube series Instant Influencer,[221] produced and starred in Ramez Silyan's short film Sorry,[222] modeled at Rihanna's Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2,[223] and released a merchandise collection,[224] as well as a single with Lodato, "I Blame You".[225] In 2021, Hilton, who founded Paris Hilton Entertainment in 2006, renamed the company 11:11 Media.[226] That year, she created London Audio, in partnership with iHeartMedia,[227] and Slivington Manor Entertainment, with an overall deal at Warner Bros. Unscripted Television.[228]

Netflix released Cooking with Paris on August 4, 2021. It was a six-part reality series which she hosted and co-produced. It received lukewarm reviews from critics, who considered it a "fun but pointless" production,[240] and briefly entered Netflix's daily Top 10 rankings.[241] Her next reality series, Peacock's Paris in Love (2021–present), soon followed, premiering on November 11, the day she married Carter Reum.[242] For both Cooking with Paris and Paris in Love, Hilton won the Best Reality Return at the 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[243]
In 2022, Hilton released a tracksuits line,[244] a sunglasses collection with Quay Australia,[245][246] and a housewares collection on Amazon.[247][248] She voiced herself in four episodes of the YouTube animated web series Rainbow High,[249] and modeled for Versace at Milan Fashion Week.[250] That year, she performed "Stars Are Blind", alongside Christina Aguilera and Mya, at the Los Angeles Pride festival,[251] as well as with Miley Cyrus and Sia, on NBC's Miley's New Year's Eve Party.[252]
On December 30, 2022, Hilton released an updated version of the song, "Stars Are Blind (Paris' Version)", exclusively to Amazon Music,[253] which was followed by another version featuring vocals by Kim Petras on June 2, 2023.[254] She featured in Petras' single "All She Wants", from her sophomore studio album Problématique (2023).[255]

Hilton launched Parisland on The Sandbox in February 2023,[262] and Slivingland on Roblox in August 2023.[263] By February 2024, Slivingland had been visited by over 3.4 million users and reportedly "drove a staggering US$60 million in earned media ad equivalency" on Roblox.[264] In 2023, she held her first concert at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles,[265] recorded the single "Hot One",[266] collaborated with Steve Aoki on "Lighter",[267] modeled for Mugler at Paris Fashion Week,[268] released a cookware collection with Walmart,[269] and performed as a disc jockey at Tomorrowland.</p>

<p>Nicole Camille Richie (née Escovedo; born September 21, 1981) is an American media personality, fashion designer, and actress. She came to prominence after appearing on the reality television series The Simple Life (2003–2007), in which she starred alongside her friend and fellow socialite Paris Hilton. Richie's personal life attracted media attention during the series' five-year run and thereafter.
Following the conclusion of The Simple Life, Richie continued her career in television, appearing as one of the three judges on the reality competition series Fashion Star (2012–2013). She later starred in the unscripted comedy series Candidly Nicole (2014–2015), which ran for two seasons. From 2017 to 2018, Richie starred in her first series regular acting role as Portia Scott-Griffith in the sitcom Great News. In 2020, she became a judge on the reality competition series Making the Cut. In fashion, Richie is the founder of the lifestyle brand House of Harlow. Richie has also published two novels.Nicole Camille Escovedo was born in Berkeley, California. She is of English, Mexican, and Creole African-American descent.[3] Her biological father, Peter Michael Escovedo, is the brother of musician Sheila E. and nephew of guitarist Alejandro Escovedo,[4] and her biological mother is Karen Moss.[5] When she was three years old, her biological parents decided to leave her under the care of Lionel Richie and his first wife Brenda Harvey Richie's family because they could not afford to provide for her.[6] Lionel and Brenda Harvey Richie became her guardians.[7] His 1986 hit song "Ballerina Girl" was written about Nicole.[8][9][10]
Brenda Harvey and Lionel Richie legally adopted Nicole when she was nine years old.[11][12] When Lionel and Brenda went through a bitter public split, they were indulgent to the young Nicole. "Their way of making me happy was to say yes to everything I wanted, but I don't think a little girl should have that much freedom," said Richie in a 2006 interview with Vanity Fair.[13] Following the divorce, Lionel remarried and had two more children: Miles (b. 1994) and Sofia (b. 1998).[14][15] Richie's godmother is Nancy Davis, daughter of Marvin Davis and mother of Brandon Davis.[16] Richie regularly interacted with musicians her father knew, including Michael Jackson (who was her godfather), Prince and Kenny Rogers.[17] Quincy Jones said in a People magazine interview that he had "known Nicole Richie since she was a baby. She's a very smart girl".[18]
Richie graduated from Montclair College Preparatory School in 1999, then attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, alongside Kourtney Kardashian and Luke Walton, where she studied Arts and Media. She did not have a definitive study plan in Arizona, dropped out after two years, and returned to California.[11] In 2003, Richie and her best friend, Paris Hilton, starred in the reality series The Simple Life, in which they lived for a month with a family in the rural community of Altus, Arkansas.[19] The series premiere debuted on Fox on December 2, 2003, to 13 million viewers, increasing Fox's reach among viewers 18–49.[20] The series continued for a second and third season.[21]
Fox subsequently canceled the show after a dispute between Hilton and Richie, but it was aired by E! Entertainment Television for its fourth season, drawing nearly one million viewers and was followed by a relatively unsuccessful fifth season.[22] Complications arose during production of the fifth season, with both Richie and Hilton facing major charges for DUI, and at risk of serving jail time. Hilton was sentenced to 23 days in jail, though this was after production of the season had finished.[23] Richie accepted a plea agreement and was sentenced to four days in jail, again after production had wrapped.[24] Despite talks of a sixth season,[25] the series finished its run at the end of the moderately unsuccessful fifth season.[26][27]
In 2005, Richie made her acting debut in the comedy film Kids in America. Richie has guest starred in television series including Eve, Six Feet Under, American Dreams, 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, and Chuck.[28] Richie appeared as a guest judge during the premiere episode of the seventh season of the reality competition series Project Runway.[29] From 2012 to 2013, she judged the reality competition series Fashion Star.[30] From 2014 to 2015, Richie starred in the unscripted comedy series Candidly Nicole.[31][32] It is loosely based on Richie's posts on Twitter.[33]
In 2016, Richie was cast as Portia Scott-Griffith, a news anchor, in the sitcom Great News, created by Tracey Wigfield and produced by Wigfield and Tina Fey.[34] The acting role marked Richie's first as a regular on a television series.[35] When speaking about Richie's casting, Fey stated that she was "a really funny person" with "an instant likability" and "good timing without really pushing it."[36] The series premiered on NBC in April 2017.[37] Sonia Saraiya of Variety called Richie's performance "a turn that reveals her substantial comedic talents",[37] while The Washington Post's Emily Yahr highlighted how she "artfully delivers her many one-liners".[35] The series concluded in 2018 after two seasons.[38]
In 2020, she created, executive produced, and starred in digital platform Quibi's series Nikki Fre$h, which chronicles the career of Richie's rapper alter ego of the same name.[39] That same year, she appeared as a judge in the reality competition series Making the Cut.[40] Richie has been featured in several fashion blogs and magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, Seventeen, Lucky, Marie Claire, Elle, InStyle, Paper, Company, Nylon, Tatler, Flare and Teen Vogue.[45] She has also modeled for Australia's Vogue and Elle; US' People, Stuff, Blender and Hollywood Reporter; Mexico's Marie Claire and UK's Glamour.[45] Richie has been the face of Bongo Jeans and Jimmy Choo advertising campaigns. In April 2007, Richie announced plans to start a jewelry, accessories, and sunglasses line along with a perfume and style book.[46] In October 2008, she debuted a jewelry line, named House of Harlow.[47] The line became available at Kitson's online boutique.[48] In spring 2010, the line was extended to include apparel and shoes. House of Harlow later became a lifestyle brand including eyewear, home fragrance, and accessories.[49]
In 2009, Richie joined maternity store A Pea in the Pod to create the new collection maternity clothes.[50] The line was titled "Nicole" which had pieces that she would wear as an expectant mother.[51] In February 2010, Richie expanded her fashion business with a women's line called Winter Kate, her daughter's two middle names. The collection was inspired by timeless prints and shapes, beautiful paisley and florals.[52]
In 2010, Richie won "Entrepreneur of the Year" for her House of Harlow brand at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards.[53] House of Harlow was also nominated in the category "Celebrity Fashion Line" at the 2010 Teen Choice Awards.[54] In July 2011, the brand unveiled a 14-piece handbag collection, which became available at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Shopbop.[55] In May 2012, it was reported both Ritchie's lines, House of Harlow 1960 and Winter Kate reached estimated sales of $55 million combined while Richie only receives 5% of revenues, according to the Hollywood Reporter.[56] She launched a collection for Macy's Impulse line in September 2012, which was sold in 100 Macy's stores as well as online.[57] Her first fragrance, Nicole by Nicole Richie, was also launched in September 2012.[58][59] Her second fragrance, No Rules by Nicole Richie was launched in March 2014.[60]
In 2017, Richie became Urban Decay's brand ambassador, representing their "Troublemaker" mascara.[61][62] House of Harlow partnered with Urban Decay for a limited-edition collection in April 2018. The line was exclusively sold at Revolve's official website.[63]</p>

<p>The Simple Life is an American reality television series starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. It depicts the two wealthy socialites, as they struggle to do jobs such as cleaning rooms, farm work, serving meals in fast-food restaurants, and working as camp counselors. The series premiered on December 2, 2003, on Fox, and concluded on August 5, 2007, on E!.[1] A falling-out between Hilton and Richie in 2005 led the series to be cancelled by Fox following its third season.[2] It was eventually picked up by E!, which aired its fourth and fifth seasons. The Simple Life helped catapult Hilton and Richie into international stardom,[3] and maintained a consistently high viewership throughout its run on both networks.[4][5] It also spawned a number of international remakes.[6]
Series overviewMain article: List of The Simple Life episodes In the first season, Paris and Nicole agreed to leave behind their cellphones, credit cards and celebrity status to move in with the Leding family in Altus, Arkansas for a month. The second season follows the two socialites traveling across the United States in a pink pickup truck (driven by Paris), pulling an airstream trailer, and participating in such activities as catching craw fish, working as maids in a nudist resort, and sausage-making.[7] In the third season, Paris and Nicole take various internships with companies along the East Coast of the United States. For the fourth season, both women alternated in the "wife" role to a different family every episode, in a similar manner to Wife Swap.[8] The fifth and final season follows Hilton and Richie working as counselors at Camp Shawnee.[9]The idea for The Simple Life was generated in Fox's comedy department. Brad Johnson, Senior Vice President of comedy development, said The Simple Life was born out of a challenge from Fox Television Entertainment Group Chairman, Sandy Grushow, and News Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer, Peter Chernin, to find another way to do comedies outside of the traditional sitcom format.
"The areas that seemed simplest and cleanest was to go back to those high-concept 1960s sitcoms and say let's do them for real", Johnson said. The Simple Life was inspired by Green Acres, a sitcom about a New York society couple who moved to a farm. Johnson said they originally thought of moving an entire family to the South. Cameras would observe as the former socialites, deprived of access to their bank accounts and Beemers, attempt to get a job, buy groceries, and fit in with average Americans. At the same time the comedy department was developing the idea, Paris Hilton was meeting with the studio's casting department. Sharon Klein, senior VP of casting at the studio, said she was immediately fascinated by Hilton and wanted to do a show with her. "I'm used to meeting with actors who are putting on a facade", Klein said. "She was so real. She was funny. At that first meeting she did not come off stupid. She was in her own reality and not embarrassed to talk about it. There was a sweetness to her."
The two departments talked and realized they had their show: Send Paris Hilton and her sister Nicky, who had never worked a day in their lives, to live and work on a farm. At the time, the studio was working closely with Mike Darnell, head of reality programming at Fox, who liked the idea. "They wanted to see stilettos in cow shit," Klein said.[10] Paris was convinced to come on board, however Nicky, being somewhat shy to the limelight at the time, opted out. Paris told some media that she was in talks to do the show by herself,[11] but ultimately, Fox decided the city-living cast had to be a duo. Paris allegedly asked several close friends on board, including Kimberly Stewart and Band Aid heiress, Casey Johnson. After Johnson declined, Hilton ended up making the agreement with Nicole Richie.
Production and initial airing on Fox
Fox hired Bunim-Murray Productions to produce the series.[12] The first season was filmed from April to May 2003, in Altus, Arkansas, and the 8-episode first season premiered on December 2, 2003.[13] During its airing, Fox added two extra episodes, one of which was a reunion special. The second season was filmed from March to April 2004, and aired from June 16 to August 5, 2004, and consisted of 10 episodes (plus a television special). The special, titled The Simple Life – The Stuff We Weren't Allowed To Show You, aired on November 17, 2004.[14] It showcased several cut scenes from the season (some of which appear on its DVD release) as well as preview clips for the third season. Filming for the third season took place from October to November 2004. It aired from January 25 to May 12, 2005, consisting of 16 episodes.
Fox cancellation and move to E!
In an interview with USA Today, Hilton confirmed the rumor that she and Nicole were no longer friends, and that Nicole would not be part of the fourth season. However, Fox Network head Peter Ligouri told the 2005 Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles that Paris and Nicole were actually both contracted for another two seasons, and that Paris and Nicole are, in his words "TV professionals, who will be ready to work together when the time comes."[15] Fox ultimately canceled its plans for any further seasons of The Simple Life in October 2005, both because it had filled its mid-season show quota, and because Paris and Nicole had had the falling out as friends.
After it was dropped by Fox, other networks, such as NBC, UPN, The WB, VH1, and MTV were all reported to be interested in obtaining the rights to air new seasons of the show.[16] On November 28, 2005, E! announced that they had picked up The Simple Life and had ordered production go ahead on the fourth season, along with the rights to re-air the first three seasons. Filming for the new season began February 27, 2006.[17] It premiered on June 5, 2006.[18] The fifth and final season of The Simple Life debuted on Memorial Day, on May 28, 2007, and ended on August 5, 2007.
Final cancellation by E!On July 30, 2007, E! announced that they had canceled the show, stating: "The Simple Life has been a wonderful addition to the E! Schedule for two years and we will always be grateful to Paris and Nicole for their hard work and graciousness."[19] That day, at the premiere of Rush Hour 3, Hilton herself said that, "It's been a great five years and we had so much fun, but I'm happy to end it at that," suggesting she had opted out of any continuation of the series.[20] Distribution rights to The Simple Life are held by Disney-ABC Domestic Television.
ReceptionCritical responseDespite a significant criticism of reality television and the scrutiny that both Hilton and Richie faced throughout The Simple Life's run, the series received moderately positive reviews from critics, who generally highlighted its tongue-in-cheek humour in spite of its vacuous nature.[21][22] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 69% based on 16 reviews. The site's critical consensus states, "The Simple Life is an incredibly vapid show, but there is no denying that Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are downright entertaining."[23] Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry considered that the series was "made palatable and watchable because the primary objects of derision are heiress/party girls Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Easy-to-promote concept plays like a light-hearted romp, where mercifully [...] nobody has learned much of anything".[24] Ken Tucker, for Entertainment Weekly, gave the series a "B" rating and asserted that "the producers know precisely what tone to take".[25] Seattle Post-Intelligencer editor Melanie McFarland remarked: "Hilton and Richie try to bring Beverly fabulousness, and brattiness, to the country folk. They fail miserably. We all get a good laugh. At least their unapologetic shallowness and good-natured mental incapacity carry the thing through".[26]U.S. television ratings
The December 2, 2003 debut of The Simple Life drew 13 million viewers, increasing Fox's adults 18-49 rating a "phenomenal" 79%.[4] The second episode showed a growth in ratings, reaching 13.3 million viewers.[27] An audience of 9.8 million viewers watched the series' second-season premiere on June 16, 2004.[28] After moving to E!, the series' fourth season premiered on June 4, 2006, drawing 1.3 million viewers. While "those ratings would have been dismal for Fox, it was actually more than four times E!'s prime-time average". According to TV Week, "ratings more than tripled from the network's average" in key adult demographic groups.[5]</p>
